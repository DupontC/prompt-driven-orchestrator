/// The Merge node and its resolver are gone (ADR-0079): every isolated node
/// merges its own sub-worktree back into the Run branch when it finishes, so the
/// only merge decisions left are the merge-back ones below.
///
/// This module is the *decision* half of the split `worktree_ops` documents: the
/// git **effect** (`MergeResult`, the shell-outs) lives there, the pure verdict
/// lives here. `spawn_base_sha` follows that rule — it reads the event log and
/// nothing else; comparing its answer to the branch's actual tip is the effect
/// layer's job.
use crate::event_log::{Event, EventKind};

/// The commit a node's sub-worktree was cut from, as its `NodeStarted` recorded
/// it (#503, ADR-0036) — the `base_sha` payload key written by both spawn paths.
///
/// This is the whole basis of the merge-back adoption rule: the pipeline branch is
/// created from the run's base and only ever receives this run's own work, so if
/// its tip is *still* this commit, then every commit the tip has and the node's
/// branch lacks is a commit the node **started from** and rewrote (a `Ship It`
/// node rebasing onto a moved `main` rewrites exactly that). Resolving the
/// conflict in the node's favour then supersedes the run's own history and
/// nothing else.
///
/// Deliberately **structural**, not content-based: no predicate over trees or
/// paths can tell "the same work, rewritten" from "different work" — the three
/// candidates were measured against the real occurrence and all three refuse it
/// (ADR-0036 §3).
///
/// Anchored on the **last** `NodeStarted` for `(node_id, iter)`: `restart_node`
/// and `invalidate_nodes` re-spawn the same iteration, and only the most recent
/// spawn says what the current sub-worktree stands on.
///
/// Careful with the word "cut" here — #489 changed what a re-spawn does. It used
/// to re-cut the sub-worktree "from wherever the branch is then"; since
/// `ensure_sub_worktree`, a re-spawn of a still-present sub-worktree **reuses it in
/// place** and CARRIES THIS VERY VALUE FORWARD onto the new `NodeStarted`. So the
/// last spawn is still authoritative, but on a re-spawn it is authoritative because
/// it copied the original cut, not because it made a new one. Re-deriving the base
/// at reuse time would either kill the adoption rule for every restarted node or arm
/// it falsely — see ADR-0037 §6.
///
/// `None` — a run created by a pre-#503 daemon, or a spawn path that recorded no
/// base — means *no adoption*. An unknown base is not a licence to rewrite a
/// branch.
