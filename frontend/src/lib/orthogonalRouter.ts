// Orthogonal edge router (issue #154, design screen 14 "Edge shaping").
//
// Pure, deterministic module: given two endpoints and a set of obstacle
// rectangles, produce a right-angle (axis-aligned) polyline that connects them
// and steers clear of the obstacles. This is the "auto" routing mode — no
// waypoints are persisted for auto edges; the path is recomputed on every
// render and re-routes for free when a node moves.
//
// The router is intentionally a deep module with a tiny surface: callers hand
// it geometry and get back a polyline, never the internal grid/search details.
